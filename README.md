# CapsLock++
Original idea if from [capslock-plus](https://github.com/wo52616111/capslock-plus) and [Capslock](https://github.com/Vonng/Capslock). But it seems that `capslock-plus` is no longer maintained. And I feel painful to read its source code. So I plan to rewrite it (Some codes are directly copied from `capslock-plus`. 
# Feature
- Function based script. Easy to understand for most AHK user. (Try to have a look at `capslock-plus` and you will know why)
- Quick window swift & quick desktop swift
- Tabscript (something like auto replace)
- Easy configuration & auto reload configuration & auto reload all scripts if there is any change
# Usage

# Devlog
2018/10/4 version 0.1
- init commit
- add auto includer (all ahk file will be auto include, so you don't need to write a `#Include`)
- add hot change support (autoload scripts and .ini)
