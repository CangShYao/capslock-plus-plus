# CapsLock++
Original idea if from [capslock-plus](https://github.com/wo52616111/capslock-plus) and [Capslock](https://github.com/Vonng/Capslock). But it seems that `capslock-plus` is no longer maintained. And I feel painful to read its source code. So I plan to rewrite it (Some codes are directly copied from `capslock-plus`. 
# Feature
- Function based script. Easy to understand for most AHK user. (Try to have a look at `capslock-plus` and you will know why)
- Quick window swift
- Tabscript (something like auto replace)
- Easy configuration & auto reload configuration
